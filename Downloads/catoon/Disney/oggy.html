    <h3>Oggy and the Cockroaches is an animated TV series about a blue cat named Oggy who
         lives in a house with three mischievous cockroaches, Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. Oggy spends
          his time watching television and enjoying simple pleasures, but his life is constantly disrupted
           by the Cockroaches' antics, which often involve plundering his refrigerator and other slapstick 
           pranks. While Oggy frequently tries to defend himself and get rid of the Cockroaches, he
            sometimes displays a surprising amount of sympathy for them, especially when they are in
             danger. The series is known for its slapstick humor and fast-paced action, according to
              Wikipedia. Oggy and the Cockroaches is an animated TV series about a blue cat named Oggy
